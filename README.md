## Tools

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the GNU Project's shell(Bourne Again SHell), which is an sh-compatible shell that integrates together useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh).

[PowerShell Core](https://microsoft.com/PowerShell) is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It also includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.

[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview) is a set of cmdlets for managing Microsoft Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. 

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/) is a compatibility layer developed by Microsoft for running Linux binary executables in a Executable/Linkable Format natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server.

[AWS Shell](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is a command-line shell program that provides convenience and productivity features to help both new and advanced users of the AWS Command Line Interface.

[Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) is a free admin machine with browser-based command-line access for managing your infrastructure and applications on Google Cloud Platform.

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) is a shell designed for interactive use and also a powerful scripting language.

[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) is an awesome community-driven (with 1700+ contributors) framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 200+ optional plugins (rails, git, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, php, python, etc), over 140 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.

[fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux, and Windows. fish includes features like syntax highlighting, autosuggest-as-you-type, and fancy tab completions that just work, with no configuration required.

[Dash (Debian Almquist shell)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dash) is a modern [POSIX-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as small as possible.

[VS Code Bash Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rogalmic.bash-debug) is a bash debugger GUI frontend based on awesome bashdb scripts (bashdb now included in package).

[VS Code Bash IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mads-hartmann.bash-ide-vscode) is a Visual Studio Code extension utilizing the [bash language server](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/blob/master/bash-lsp), that is based on [Tree Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) and its [grammar for Bash](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) and supports [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/) integration.
